I, Dr. Md. Zahidul Islam, was born on December 29th, 1978, in Kushtia, Bangladesh. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Applied Physics and Electronic Engineering from the University of Rajshahi (RU), Bangladesh, in
2000 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, I embarked on my academic career as a lecturer in the Department of Information and Communication Engineering at Islamic University (IU) in Kushtia, Bangladesh. 

In June 2018, I was appointed as a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Green University of Bangladesh, a position I held until June 2020 while on lien leave. My doctoral research, focusing on Visual Object Tracking Systems, was conducted in the Department of Computer Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Chil-Woo Lee at the Intelligent Image Media & Interface Lab, Chonnam National University (CNU), South Korea. I was awarded my Ph.D. from the same department in August 2011.

Furthermore, I completed a research internship in the 3D Vision Lab at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Suwon, South Korea. My research interests are diverse and include computer vision, 3D object recognition, human and motion tracking, tracking articulated bodies, as well as exploring the potentials of genetic algorithms and bioinformatics.
